# Night Writer

The idea of [Night Writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_writing) was first developed for Napoleon's army so soldiers could communicate silently at night without light. The concept of night writing led to Louis Braille's development of his [Braille tactile writing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille).
